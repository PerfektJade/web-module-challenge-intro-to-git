## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git is an open source version control system.
2. Git is a software, and GitHub is a service.
3. We create a branch to work without affecting other branches in the repo.
4. The purpose of a Pull Request is to let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repo on GitHub.
5. The command you can use to switch between branches is "git switch" and the name of the branch you want to switch into.
6. "git fetch" downloads objects and refs from another repo; "git merge" joins two or more development histories together; "git pull" incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.
7. A merge conflict happens when you merge branches that have competing commits and you have to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.
8. You can resolve simple merge conflicts that involve competing line changes on GitHub, using the conflict editor; for other merge conflicts, use the command line and a text editor.
